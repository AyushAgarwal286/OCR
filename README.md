Text is everywhere! It is present in PDFs, docs as well as images. There are lots of applications where text data is useful for doing analytics. Such applications include receipts recognition, number plate detection, extracting the latex formulas from the images etc. General Computer Vision can be used for such task but it lacks in accuracy. In order to solve the low accuracy and variance problem, we use the state of the art deep neural networks.

This repository includes:
```
1. A TensorFlow implementation of the CNN+LSTM+CTC model for OCR.
2. supporting scripts to apply the RCNN appraoch for OCR.
```
